# Lobby Bar

- Inconcistency between menu displays between locations
  - For example, the brunch in Hamilton has only deserts, the brunch in Toronto only has drinks.
  - Prices are different format (2.99 vs 3)
- I would make all menus look the same in terms of title, description and price (font, color, size, etc.)
- Inconcistency in package descriptions (some have 1X, some don't)
- I want change main page video to full size at all screens
  - Might need to add a message below it in between video and "lobby" image
